a new enhancement for the Target View:
Add a dropdown for a third lens to be added to the view. By default it is set to None which works the same as current behaviour.
The dropdown should show the list of Architecture Lenses.
If one is selected, the visible secondary lens items should be evaluated to see if they have a a relationship to the third lens. The way to display it is to have the values of the third lens as sub-columns in the Current and Target view.
If an item is not related to any third lens item: the box for the item should cover all of the sub-columns. 
If the item is related to all of the third lens items: the box for the item should cover all of the sub-columns (same behaviour as for not related items.
If the item is only related to one or some of the third lens items, the box should be coloured in for the columns that match.
does this make sense?
